# Mongo Fox News Scraper

## Overview

Mongo Fox News Scraper is a web-scraping application that pulls the latest articles from Fox News and saves them to the Mongo Scraper database. The app then populates the page with the Title, link, and a short description of each article. The user is able to add comments to each article and will be able to see them later if they choose to log back in.

Mongo Scraper uses MongoDB as its database (hence the name) as well as the Mongoose package for further validation and relational mapping. It also uses the body-parser, express, cheerio (to scrape the website), and request packages.
